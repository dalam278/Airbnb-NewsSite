Assignment - Airbnb News Clone
Yes, we are going to do another cloning assignment. But you will be using Bootstrap 4 this time. The site we are cloning is https://news.airbnb.com/. It is a very standard Bootstrapesque design.
Expectations
I expect you to work to the best of your ability and effort to create a clone of the news page of Airbnb. It should satisfy the following:

Reference the live version on https://news.airbnb.com/.
Has a navigation bar, main content, and footer.
Be mobile responsive.
Has similar layout as the original website.
Use free images sourced from the internet.
Has a drop down navigation menu for mobile screens using Bootstrap's drop down system.
You can attempt the language drop down menu in the navigation bar.
You only need to clone the first three rows of articles. Further rows are just repeated layout and you don't need to clone them.
Use mostly bootstrap 4 classes with a little of your own custom css.

You do not need to clone interactive behaviours, such as navbar slide out effect, or the carousell. These require more advanced coding in JavaScript.

I do not expect a pixel perfect clone. The search button in the navigation menu does not need to be functional. The content of the live page will update periodically, you don't have have to use the same content. The key to this project is styling and layout. You can repeat 2 or 3 article contents if that makes it easier.

Use this example https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navbar/#supported-content for the base of your navbar, you will have a much easier time with it. Do not use the navbar structure we used in the previous cloning walkthrough.
Deliverables
You can either work on Repl.it or locally on your computer. If you are working locally, make sure you upload your assignment onto netlify.com and send me the link. If you decide to work on repl.it, please submit the repl link.
!! Note on plagiarism !!
We do not accept direct copy of the source files of the example site or other student's submissions. Please try to do as much on your own as possible. Referencing the example site for ideas is fine, do not copy and paste of the source files from the example site.
